Creating SSH Key - The Common Steps and Commands
==================================================
1- Creating SSH directory ".ssh" on local machine "laptop"
    cd ~
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    press enter twice for file name & password "not required so far!!" --> or it is a better practice to create a password with our default password
2- Navigate to SSH directory and read the public key
    cd ~/.ssh
    cat id_rsa.pub
    copy the file content and paste it into the public SSH key section in the cloud SSH key
    give a name for the SSH key being created for the cloud server
3- Connect to the server using ssh command
    ssh user_name@server_ip_or_name
    accept the warning message about the public key fingerprint (yes) "this is because of the first time connection to the server"
    then now you are connected!!
4- Creating a config file to make the connectivity to servers much easier
    touch config
    Type inside the config file the following:
    Host *
     UseKeychain yes
     AddKeysToAgent yes
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/(private_key_name)
